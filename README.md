# UF Value Table and Graph

This is a single page web application that shows a table of historical values of the 'Unidad de Fomento' (UF) currency in Chile. The application allows the user to perform CRUD operations on the UF values, and also generates a graph that displays the UF value over time.

## Getting Started

To use this application, you will need to have Xampp installed on your machine, and a MySQL database with a single table called 'Indicadores'. You will also need to have CodeIgniter 4 and Bootstrap 5 installed.

Once you have these prerequisites, you can clone the project from GitHub and run it locally using Xampp. You will need to configure the database connection in the 'app/Config/Database.php' file.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the UF value table and perform CRUD operations by clicking on the appropriate buttons. You can also generate a graph by selecting the 'Graph' button and setting the 'from-to' periods to visualize the UF value over time.

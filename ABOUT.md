UF Value Table and Graph is a single page web application that allows users to view and manage historical values of the 'Unidad de Fomento' (UF) currency in Chile. The project was created by SOLUTORIA SpA as a programming test for job candidates.

The application is built using CodeIgniter 4 and Bootstrap 5, and uses a MySQL database with a single table called 'Indicadores'. Users can perform CRUD operations on the UF values and generate a graph that displays the UF value over time, with the ability to set the 'from-to' periods to visualize the UF value over time.
